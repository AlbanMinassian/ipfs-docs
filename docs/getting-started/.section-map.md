# Getting started section map

This is a map for the upcoming **Getting started** section. The titles are not final.

```
/getting-started
In this section you will learn xyz.

	/what-is-ipfs
    Define, with as few buzzwords as possible: what IPFS is and what it does.

    /problems-with-the-internet
    Stuff doesn't work. This page explains problems like users have to know exactly where the data is, if the data moves then they need a new address, and there's no in-built way to check that the data you get back is correct. Also, there's a much risk of data becoming unavailable, blocked, lost, or modified.

    /ipfs-fixes-these-problems
    Using content addressing, Bitswap, and the DHT, IPFS is able to tackle the problems presented by current internet infrastructure. But it also comes with some new costs and questions of it's own. Mainly, _how do we share data efficently if we don't know where it is_.
