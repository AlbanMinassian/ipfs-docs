# Work with remote pinning services

Intro: Use a (third-party, remote) pinning service or create your own

Local vs remote pinning services: when to use which one.
Use local pinning to ensure files on your local node persist and are never garbage-collected. You can also link your accounts with otherâ€¨pinning services to automatically or selectively persist files with those providers, enabling you to keep backup copies of your files and/or make them available to others when your local node is offline. Check the documentation for further information.
